# Development Status - Linkpoint-kotlin

## Project Overview

Linkpoint-kotlin is a modern Kotlin-based virtual world viewer that imports and modernizes functionality from established virtual world viewers. This project successfully demonstrates the complete implementation of importing C# and C++ code concepts from SecondLife, Firestorm, Restrained Love, and Lumiya viewers into a contemporary, cross-platform Kotlin application.
