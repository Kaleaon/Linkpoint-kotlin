# Linkpoint-kotlin

A modern Kotlin-based virtual world viewer that imports and modernizes concepts from established Second Life viewers.

## Overview

Linkpoint-kotlin aims to create a contemporary virtual world viewer by importing and modernizing functionality from:

- **SecondLife Viewer** - Official Linden Lab viewer with core virtual world functionality
- **Firestorm Viewer** - Popular third-party viewer with advanced features and optimizations  
- **Restrained Love Viewer (RLV)** - Specialized viewer with additional protocol extensions

## Architecture

The project is structured as a multi-module Kotlin application:

### Core Modules

- **`:core`** - Core viewer systems, event handling, and lifecycle management
- **`:protocol`** - Virtual world protocol implementation (SecondLife/OpenSim compatible)
- **`:graphics`** - 3D rendering engine and graphics pipeline
- **`:ui`** - User interface components and interaction handling
- **`:audio`** - Audio processing and spatial sound systems
- **`:assets`** - Asset management, caching, and streaming

### Key Components Being Imported

#### From SecondLife Viewer
- Core virtual world protocol (UDP messaging, XMLRPC login)
- Basic avatar and object rendering
- Chat and instant messaging systems
- Inventory management
- Physics and movement systems

#### From Firestorm Viewer  
- Advanced rendering optimizations
- Enhanced UI/UX features
- Extended search and discovery features
- Media streaming improvements
- Performance monitoring and debugging tools

#### From Restrained Love Viewer
- Extended protocol messages and capabilities
- Additional avatar control mechanisms
- Enhanced scripting interfaces
- Specialized interaction modes

## Development Status

### âœ… Completed Foundation
- [x] Initial project structure and architecture
- [x] Core module architecture with lifecycle management
- [x] Event system framework implemented
- [x] Protocol module with data structures ready
- [x] Graphics engine foundation laid
- [x] RLV protocol extension framework
- [x] Clean, production-ready codebase (no demo/dummy data)

### âœ… Batch Processing System (NEW!)
- [x] **Batch Download System** - Downloads all target repositories automatically
- [x] **Code Conversion Engine** - Converts C++/C# to Kotlin with debugging
- [x] **LLSD Standards Application** - Labels and organizes all components
- [x] **Progress Tracking** - Complete transparency and monitoring
- [x] **Sub-task Generation** - Creates tasks for @copilot assignment

### ðŸš§ Ready for Implementation  
- [ ] XML parsing in Login System (critical for SecondLife connectivity)
- [ ] UDP message processing loop (critical for real-time communication)
- [ ] Message template parsing and generation
- [ ] OpenGL rendering pipeline
- [ ] User interface components (login, chat, inventory)
- [ ] Asset management and caching

See [IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md](IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md) for detailed implementation priorities.

## Building and Running

### Batch Processing System (NEW!)
```bash
# Download and convert all viewer codebases
./batch-download-convert.sh

# Run batch processor demonstration
cd batch-processor && ./demo-batch-processing.sh
```

### Quick Start (No Dependencies)
```bash
# Build and run with core functionality
./simple-build.sh
```

### Full Build (When Dependencies Resolved)
```bash
# Build all modules
./gradlew build

# Run with full features  
./gradlew run
```

### Testing SecondLife Connectivity
The system is ready for SecondLife integration. Key implementation points:
1. Add XML parsing library to `build.gradle.kts`
2. Implement XMLRPC parsing in `LoginSystem.kt` (line 268)
3. Implement UDP message loop in `UDPMessageSystem.kt` (line 301)

See [IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md](IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md) for complete details.

## Import Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

### Phase 2: Protocol Implementation
1. Import and modernize login system from SL viewer
2. Implement UDP messaging for simulator communication
3. Add basic object and avatar data handling
4. Create foundation for extended protocols (RLV)

### Phase 3: Rendering System
1. Import 3D rendering concepts from SL/Firestorm
2. Modernize graphics pipeline with current OpenGL/Vulkan
3. Implement efficient scene management
4. Add support for mesh, textures, and animations

### Phase 4: User Interface
1. Create modern UI framework inspired by Firestorm
2. Implement chat, inventory, and world interaction
3. Add search and discovery features
4. Create preferences and settings management

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
