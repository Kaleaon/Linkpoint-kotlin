Linkpoint-kotlin Batch Processing Summary
========================================

Download Status:
- SecondLife Viewer: Downloaded (if successful)
- Firestorm Viewer: Downloaded (if successful)  
- Libremetaverse: Downloaded (if successful)
- Restrained Love Viewer: Downloaded (if successful)

Conversion Status:
- Basic file structure created
- Full conversion requires running the Kotlin batch processor
- LLSD labeling system available for component organization

Next Steps:
1. Fix any gradle build issues in batch-processor/
2. Run the full Kotlin conversion system
3. Apply LLSD standards to all components
4. Generate sub-tasks for @copilot

Total repositories processed: 4
Processing time: Variable based on network speed
